Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <p>Most TV stations require that you have a college degree, preferably in broadcast journalism. Getting a degree in English or Communications is also a big help. Some schools that have top broadcast journalism programs are Brigham Young University, University Missouri Columbia, Northwestern University, Syracuse University and Arizona State University.</p>

              <h3>Get relevant experience at your undergraduate institution.</h3>
              <p>When you're in college, you'll have to do more than just get your bachelor's degree if you want to take your career to the next level. Join your school newspaper and get some practice writing stories, investigating leads, and understanding the hard work needed to provide your audience with a good story. If you have a local college TV station, try to involved there, eventually ending up as an anchor or reporter if you can.</p>

              <h3>Learn how to write for TV.</h3>
              <p>You of course learn some of this in school. Writing for TV is very different from writing a term paper. You need to learn how to write to the images your audience will see on TV. It’s called writing to video. Also, you should keep writing simple and stay away from legalese and clichés. You have only one shot to get the attention of folks at home.</p>

              <h3>Create a resumé tape.</h3>
              <p>A resumé tape is a reel that shows a sample of your reporting/anchoring skills. It usually starts with a slate – a brief showing of your name and contact information. The slate is usually followed by a montage, which is a short segment of compelling live shots, samples of reporting and anchoring. The montage is then followed by three of your best stories.</p>

              <p>Don't just apply to the stations that are hiring. Send your tape and resumé absolutely everywhere that you can send it without being a nuisance. You never know when an opening will appear, and having your tape on the right person's desk at the right time can increase your chances of getting that job.</p>

              <p>Sure, you may want to hold out for San Diego, California but if Biloxi, Mississippi offers you your first job, you should probably say yes. Send your tape and apply everywhere you can, and be prepared to step out of your comfort zone.</p>

              <h3>Prepare to get little pay at the beginning.</h3>
              <p>The average reporter job in a small market gets paid between $15,000 and $18,000 a year. Not what you expected? Contrary to popular belief, most TV personalities are not rolling in dough. Television news is a field where the supply outweighs the demand. Basically there are more people who want to be on TV than there are available positions. That’s part of the reason why pay is not competitive.</p>

              <p>Once you've put in at least 3-5 years at a small station and have found some success, you can start moving up in the ranks. Apply for work at larger stations, or even medium-sized stations, and see what you can do. Apply everywhere, not just places that have openings, and use your great experience as a way to back up the fact that you'll be an amazing candidate for the job.</p>
